I developed a full-featured Employee Management System for companies using HTML5, JavaScript, Bootstrap, AJAX, PHP, MySQL, and APIs. The system streamlines HR tasks, enabling easy employee data management, performance tracking, work hour logging, and department organization. It includes role-based admin access, responsive design for all devices, and enhanced UX through AJAX and API integration for seamless performance and future scalability.
